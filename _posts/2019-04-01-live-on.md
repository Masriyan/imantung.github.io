Life means to be growing.  
The best way to grow is to make something.  
Something is not easy to make, You need motivation.  
The best motivation emerge when meeting people.  
Make sure you well prepared, with a clear mind, meditate always.  
When the sparks come out, let's go my friend.   
Run... Fly... Catch it up with the whole body.  
But don't forget to insure everything. Stay healthy, you must.  
The best insurance paid with sweat. Don't skip the exercise.  
All door in front of you will be open with the right key.  
That key is attitude.  
A attitude to live on.
