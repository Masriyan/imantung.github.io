"Year resolution in mid of May!?"

Why not? 

Last two years is a tough year for me. Plan after plan. Disappointment to another disappointment. I never really ask anything for myself to anyone. I even never really expect something, just do my job best. But this year, I really want to be something different, became better. 

So this my 2019 resolution: 

1. Get Involve as many projects as possible, working with as many engineers as possible and finish my own personal project. 
2. Learn more, write the article regularly, giving talks, meet people, read book challenge (but 1 new book every 2 weeks). 
3. Get work-life balance, find a new experience, start a new hobby, traveling more, meditate and exercise every day.
