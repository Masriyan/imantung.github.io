"Year resolution in mid of May!?"

Why not? 

Last two years is a tough year for me. Plan after plan. Disappointment to another disappointment. I never really ask anything for myself or anyone. I even never really expect something, just want to do my job best. But this year, I really want to be something different, to became better a person, to level up. 

So this my 2019 resolution: 

1. Get involve to as many projects as possible, working with as many engineers as possible and finish my own personal project. 
2. Learn more, write the article regularly, giving talks when possible, meet and brain storm with everyone, read more book. 
3. Get work-life balance, get new experience, start a new hobby, traveling more, meditate and exercise every day.
