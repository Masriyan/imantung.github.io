So I got this csv file generated by dbeaver to trigger some automation task but my code can't process it.
The file is perfect until I open it on excel and I see this `ï»¿`. So this is the culprit. Actually it's quite famous and known as Byte Order Mark (BOM)

Unicode text can optionally start with a byte order mark (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is `U+FEFF`. In UTF-32 for example, a big-endian file should start with `00 00 FE FF`; a little-endian should start with `FF FE 00 00`.

In case of DBeaver, we can uncheck `Insert BOM` option when generate csv.
