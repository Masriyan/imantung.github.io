My little note on HTTP caching

## Where or how do we handle the caching? 

A (web) system have a lot of tier.

1. Client-Side Caching
   Browsers cache the data in its local storage

2. Intermediary Caching
   Intermediaries are something between client and server ([RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.3)) like proxy or gateway. Cache mechanism is handled by [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-caching-guide/), [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/intro/index.html#intro) or another caching-proxy. 
    
3. Server-Side Caching
   Backends cache the database inquiry or communication to some vendors.
   

## Can we control it? 

The best practice is using cache-directive (`Cache-Control` header).

Using cache-directive, you can:
- Modify the expiration time
- Decide to store/cache or not  
- Revalidate/reload the data

Combining with question #1. Is `Cache-Control` for client, intermediary or server? The answer is mentioned in [RFC2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9)

| The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain. 

## Conditional Request

Additionally, we can use conditional request (`ETag` and `If-Not-Match` header). The client simply handle `304 Not Modified` which is return by server when has no new data.
