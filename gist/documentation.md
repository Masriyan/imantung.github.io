[what is the meaning of xxx in code comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452934/what-is-the-meaning-of-xxx-in-code-comments)

Based on its natural priority
- `FIXME`: This works, sort of, but it could be done better. (usually code written in a hurry that needs rewriting).
- `XXX`: Warning about possible pitfalls, can be used as NOTE:XXX:.
- `HACK`: Not very well written or malformed code to circumvent a problem/bug. Should be used as HACK:FIXME:.
- `TODO`: No problem, but addtional code needs to be written, usually when you are skipping something.
