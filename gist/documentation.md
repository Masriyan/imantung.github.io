Based on its natural priority
- `NOTE:`    Description of how the code works 
- `HACK:FIXME:`/`HACK`: Not very well written or malformed code to circumvent a problem/bug. 
- `XXX`/`NOTE:XXX:`: Warning about possible pitfalls.
- `FIXME`: This works, sort of, but it could be done better. (usually code written in a hurry that needs rewriting).
- `BUG`: There is problem here
- `TODO`: No problem, but addtional code needs to be written, usually when you are skipping something.
- `DOING`: Code is not completed yet
