### Flexing

### Coaching

Preparing for the conversation
1. Create a safe environment: allow conversation to happen and someone can accept our feedback
2. Create coaching contract: decide some expectation together

How to fully aware to the conversation? Asking a question.

Question Framing:
Outcome focused > Problem focused

Give measurement to expected outcome. (Quote: "Something you can't measure, you can't manage")

### Goal Setting

People behave differently if have a goal

Bad Goal: Using Company Value/Job Description/To Do list/Long Narrative like novel

Good Goal: What, When, How, Why + Measurement + right wording (Using Active Verb)

Is it hard to implement Goal? Align between business vs individual.
- The why <> What matters to the individual
- The what <> What are their aspirations and motivations?
- The how <> What are their key strengths

How to get good performance? Challenge by stretching and affirming the goal
- Vertical stretch goal: existing activities to new heights
- Horizontal stretch goal: inspire people to take different/broader responsible

Best practice to challenge people:
1. Celebrate past success
2. Have the right mindset
3. Use helpful languages 

Goal is dynamic; be flexing.
