### Consistency Model

Eventually Consistent

Strong Consistent

### High Availability

HA = High Availability = No Downtime, Always available

SPOF = Single Point of Failure = If it fails, will stop the entire system from working

RPO = Recovery Point Objective = How much data can we loose

RTO = Recovery Time Objective = How long it take to Recovery

MTBF = Mean-Time-Between-Failures = Time between failures
