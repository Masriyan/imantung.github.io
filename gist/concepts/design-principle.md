`KISS` = Keep it simple stupid

`DRY` = Don't Repeat Yourself

`Convention over Configuration`

`Fat models, skinny controllers`

`Tell, Don't Ask`

`Idempotency`

`SOLID Principle`
1. Single responsibility principle: a class should have only a single responsibility 
2. Open/closed principle: "software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
3. Liskov substitution principle: "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." 
4. Interface segregation principle: "many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
5. Dependency inversion principle: one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
