Preparing for the conversation
1. Create a safe environment --> allow conversation to happen and someone can accept our feedback
2. Create coaching contract --> decide some expectation together

How to fully aware to the conversation? Asking a question.

Question Framing: outcome focused question > problem focused Question

Give measurement to expected outcome.

Quote: Something you can't measure, you can't manage.
