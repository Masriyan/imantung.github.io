Principle of good PBI (Product Backlog Item)

1. `Independent`	The PBI should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another PBI.
2.	`Negotiable`	PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.
3.	`Valuable`	A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.
4.	`Estimatable`	You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.
5.	`Small`	PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of accuracy.
6.	`Testable`	The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible
