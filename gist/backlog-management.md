INVEST Principle: Principle of good PBI (Product Backlog Item)  
- **I**–ndependent – The PBI should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another PBI.  
- **N**–egotiable – PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.  
- **V**–aluable – A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.  
- **E**–stimable – You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.  
- **S**–mall - PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of accuracy.  
- **T**–estable - The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.  

SMART Criteria: Giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives  
- **S**–pecific – target a specific area for improvement.  
- **M**–easurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.  
- **A**–ssignable – specify who will do it.  
- **R**–ealistic – state the results that can be achieved realistically, given available resources.  
- **T**–ime-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

ICE Scoring: Features prioritization model (Impact x Confidence x Ease)
- **I**-mpact demonstrates how much your idea will positively affect the key metric you’re trying to improve.
- **C**-onfidence shows how sure you are about Impact. It is also about ease of implementation in some way.
- **E**-ase is about the easiness of implementation. It is an estimation of how much effort and resources are required to implement this idea.
