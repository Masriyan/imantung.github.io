## Negotation

"Benefit of the doubt"

- [BATNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement): Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement

Bad faith negotiation = pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so


## Hiring

Good reading:
- <https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards>
- [Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)](https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/applicant-tracking-systems-resume-keyword-help)

My note:
1. Always process insider referral
  - "Give face" to insider
  - Motivate the insider to submit more referral
2. Always send rejection notice with manner and feedback at positive framing
  - Open the opportunity to the candidate to reapply in the future
  - Good exercise for interviewer/recruiter to make objective reason for rejection
3. Best assignment is a complete the project
  - From the code, we see problem solving skill, logic, design and attitude of candidate
  - Reviewing the assignment also good exercise

1. Lead Time: time period between the beginning of a project’s development and its delivery to the customer. 
2. Code Churn: he percentage of a developer’s own code representing an edit to their own recent work.
3. Impact: a measure of the effect that code changes have on your project, and a way to consider the cognitive load they place on the developer who implemented them.
4. Active Days: a day in which an engineer contributed code to the project
5. Efficiency: the percentage of an engineer’s contributed code that’s productive, which generally involves balancing coding output against the code’s longevity.

  - Chapter 12. Discipline Equals Freedom – The Dichotomy


A good leader must be (The Dichotomy of Leadership):
- confident but not cocky;
- courageous but not foolhardy;
- competitive but a gracious loser;
- attentive to details but not obsessed by them;
- strong but have endurance;
- a leader and follower;
- humble not passive;
- aggressive not overbearing;
- quiet not silent;
- calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions;
- close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge.
- able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command.

A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove.
