# Agile

- [The agile coach by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile)
- [Feature Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development)

## The Manifesto

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software.
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. **Business people and developers** must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a **constant pace** indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of **maximizing the amount of work not done**--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
12. At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Rule:
1. Planning
  - User Stories: User stories are written.
  - release plan: Release planning creates the release schedule.
  - release often: Make frequent small releases.
  - iterative: The project is divided into iterations.
  - iteration planning: Iteration planning starts each iteration.
2. Managing
  - optimize: last Give the team a dedicated open work space.
  - steady pace: Set a sustainable pace.
  - stand-up meeting: A stand up meeting starts each day.
  - project velocity: The Project Velocity is measured.
  - move people around: Move people around.
  - Fix XP: Fix XP when it breaks.
3. Designing
  - simplicity: Simplicity.
  - System Metaphor: Choose a system metaphor.
  - CRC cards: Use CRC cards for design sessions.
  - Spike solution: Creates spike solutions to reduce risk.
  - nothing early: No functionality is added early.
  - refactor: Refactor whenever and wherever possible.
4. Coding
  - customer on-site: The customer is always available.
  - coding standard: Code must be written to agreed standards.
  - Test Driven Development: Code the unit test first.
  - pair programming: All production code is pair programmed.
  - serial integration: Only one pair integrates code at a time.
  - continuous integration: Integrate often.
  - continuous integration: Set up a dedicated integration computer.
  - collective ownership: Use collective ownership.
5. Testing
  - unit tests: All code must have unit tests.
  - unit tests: All code must pass all unit tests before it can be released.
  - tests: When a bug is found tests are created.
  - acceptance tests: Acceptance tests are run often and the score is published.


## Scrum

- [Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)](https://less.works/)
- <http://www.nimeshsoni.com/improve-daily-standuptop-10-tips/>

The ceremonies:
1. Organize the backlog
2. Sprint planning
3. Sprint
4. Daily Scrum or Stand Up
5. Sprint review
6. Sprint retrospective

### Scrum vs Kanban

|  | SCRUM | KANBAN |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cadence | Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks) | Continuous flow |
| Release methodology |	At the end of each sprint if approved by the product owner |	Continuous delivery or at the team's discretion |
| Roles | Product owner, scrum master, development team |	No existing roles. Some teams enlist the help of an agile coach. |
| Key metrics |	Velocity | Cycle time |
| Change philosophy	| Teams should strive to not make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint. Doing so compromises learnings around estimation. |	Change can happen at any time |

### Daily Standup

1. Dit it yesterday?
2. Will do it today? 
3. Any impediment?

### Retrospective 

1. What worked Well?
2. What could be improved?
3. What will we commit to doing in the next iteration?
4. Actionable commitment?
