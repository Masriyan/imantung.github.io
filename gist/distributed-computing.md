[CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem): states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance

[ACID Properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)): set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc

[Eventually Consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) / BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) / 

### High Availability

HA = High Availability = No Downtime, Always available

SPOF = Single Point of Failure = If it fails, will stop the entire system from working

RPO = Recovery Point Objective = How much data can we loose

RTO = Recovery Time Objective = How long it take to Recovery

MTBF = Mean-Time-Between-Failures = Time between failures
