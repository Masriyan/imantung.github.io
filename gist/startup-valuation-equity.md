How it works:
1. Assign a leader
2. Set theoretical value
3. Determine percentage

Theoretical Value

| Value Type | Formula | 
|---|---|
|GHRR (Grunt Hourly Resource Rate) | (Negotiated Base Salary - Cash Compensation) * 2 / 2000 |
| Time | GHRR * hours |
| Money | Dollar Amount * 4 (2 if crowd-funding)| 
| Commission | Unpaid commission * 2 |
| Idea/patent | Unpaid royalty or Development hours + Cost |
