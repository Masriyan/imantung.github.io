## Stream Processing

1. Simple Event Processing  
Simple filter (e.g. is this gold or platinum customer)
2. Event Stream Processing  
Looking across multiple event streams and joining multiple event, etc
3. Complex Event Processing  
Processing multiple event stream to identify meaningful pattern, using complex condition & temporal windows  
e.g . There has been a more than 10% increase in overall trading activity and the average price of commodities has fallen 2% in last 4 hour


## Data Integrity

Data Integrity is the assurance that data a consistent, accurate, reliable and accessible.

"Guilty until proven innocent" approach
