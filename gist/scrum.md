### Scrum vs Kanban

|  | SCRUM | KANBAN |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cadence | Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks) | Continuous flow |
| Release methodology |	At the end of each sprint if approved by the product owner |	Continuous delivery or at the team's discretion |
| Roles | Product owner, scrum master, development team |	No existing roles. Some teams enlist the help of an agile coach. |
| Key metrics |	Velocity | Cycle time |
| Change philosophy	| Teams should strive to not make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint. Doing so compromises learnings around estimation. |	Change can happen at any time |
