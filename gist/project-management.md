INVEST Principle: Principle of good PBI (Product Backlog Item)  
**I** – Independent – The PBI should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another PBI.  
**N** – Negotiable – PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.  
**V** – Valuable – A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.  
**E** – Estimable – You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.  
**S** – Small - PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of accuracy.  
**T** – Testable - The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.

SMART Criteria: Giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives  
**S** – Specific – target a specific area for improvement.  
**M** – Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.  
**A** – Assignable – specify who will do it.  
**R** – Realistic – state the results that can be achieved realistically, given available resources.  
**T** – Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
