## Prioritization

[ICE Method](https://hygger.io/blog/ice-method-helps-choose-better-product-features/): Features prioritization model (Impact x Confidence x Ease)
- `Impact` demonstrates how much your idea will positively affect the key metric you’re trying to improve.
- `Confidence` shows how sure you are about Impact. It is also about ease of implementation in some way.
- `Ease` is about the easiness of implementation. It is an estimation of how much effort and resources are required to implement this idea.

[MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method)
- Must have
- Should have
- Could have
- Won't have (this time)

## Goal Setting 

[SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
- `Specific` – target a specific area for improvement.  
- `Measurable` – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.  
- `Assignable` – specify who will do it.  
- `Realistic` – state the results that can be achieved realistically, given available resources.  
- `Time-related` – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

## Backlog/Story/Task

[INVEST mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)): Characteristic of good PBI (Product Backlog Item)  
- `Independent` – The PBI should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another PBI.  
- `Negotiable` – PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.  
- `Valuable` – A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.  
- `Estimable` – You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.  
- `Small` - PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of accuracy.  
- `Testable` - The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.
