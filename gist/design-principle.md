`KISS` = Keep it simple stupid

`DRY` = Don't Repeat Yourself

`Convention over Configuration`

`Fat models, skinny controllers`

`Tell, Don't Ask`

`Idempotency`

`SOLID Principle`
1. `Single Responsibility Principle`: 
   - A class should have only a single responsibility
2. `Open/closed Principle`
   - Software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. `Liskov Substitution Principle`: objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
4. `Interface Segregation Principle`
  - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
  - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
5. `Dependency Inversion Principle`
  - One should depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.

`Separation of Concern`

`Law of Demeter`
- Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
- Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
- Only talk to your immediate friends.

`Common Closure Principle`
- Classes within a released component should share common closure.
- That is, if one needs to be changed, they all are likely to need to be changed.
- What affects one, affects all.

`Leaky abstraction`: an abstraction that leaks details that it is supposed to abstract away

`Persistence Ignorance`: classes modeling the business domain in a software application should not be impacted by how they might be persisted.
