## My Engineering Recruitment Note

1. Always process insider referral
  - "Give face" to insider
  - Motivate the insider to submit more referral
2. Always send rejection notice with manner and feedback at positive framing
  - Open the opportunity to the candidate to reapply in the future
  - Good exercise for interviewer/recruiter to make objective reason for reject
3. Best assignment is a complete project
  - From the code we see problem solving skill, logic, design and attitude of candidate
  - Reviewing the assignment also good exercise
