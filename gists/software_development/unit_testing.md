# Unit Testing


[F.I.R.S.T Principle](https://github.com/ghsukumar/SFDC_Best_Practices/wiki/F.I.R.S.T-Principles-of-Unit-Testing)
- Fast
- Isolated/Independent
- Repeatable
- Self-Validating
- Thorough/Timely

[The Way of Testivus](http://www.agitar.com/downloads/TheWayOfTestivus.pdf)
- If you write code, write tests.
- Donâ€™t get stuck on unit testing dogma.
- Embrace unit testing karma.
- Think of code and test as one.
- The test is more important than the unit.
- The best time to test is when the code is fresh.
- Tests not run waste away.
- An imperfect test today is better than a perfect test someday.
- An ugly test is better than no test.
- Sometimes, the test justifies the means.
- Only fools use no tools.
- Good tests fail.
