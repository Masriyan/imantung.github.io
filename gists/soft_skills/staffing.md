[STAR Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result)
- Situation (where were you; what were you doing? what was the context)
- Task (what was your aim? what was the problem?)
- Action (be clear about what you did)
- Result (what was the outcome of your actions, what did you achieve?)
