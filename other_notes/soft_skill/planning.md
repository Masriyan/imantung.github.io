# Planning

Ref:

- [command center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_center) a.k.a [war room](https://www.slideshare.net/rmurray/the-art-of-warroom)
- [Project management office (PMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_office): group/department that defines and maintains standards for project management within the organization

## Goal Setting

People behave differently if have a goal

Bad Goal: Using Company Value/Job Description/To Do list/Long Narrative like novel

Good Goal: What, When, How, Why + Measurement + right wording (Using Active Verb)

Is it hard to implement Goal? Align between business vs individual.
- The why <> What matters to the individual
- The what <> What are their aspirations and motivations?
- The how <> What are their key strengths

How to get good performance? Challenge by stretching and affirming the goal
- Vertical stretch goal: existing activities to new heights
- Horizontal stretch goal: inspire people to take different/broader responsible

Best practice to challenge people:
1. Celebrate past success
2. Have the right mindset
3. Use helpful languages 

Goal is dynamic; be flexing.  


## Backlog/Story/Task

Ref:
- [Invest in good stories and smart task](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/)

[SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
- `Specific` – target a specific area for improvement.  
- `Measurable` – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.  
- `Assignable` – specify who will do it.  
- `Realistic` – state the results that can be achieved realistically, given available resources.  
- `Time-related` – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

[INVEST mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic)): Characteristic of good PBI (Product Backlog Item)  
- `Independent` – The PBI should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another PBI.  
- `Negotiable` – PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.  
- `Valuable` – A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.  
- `Estimable` – You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.
- `Small` - PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of accuracy.  
- `Testable` - The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.  


## Prioritization

[ICE Method](https://hygger.io/blog/ice-method-helps-choose-better-product-features/): Features prioritization model (Impact x Confidence x Ease)
- `Impact` demonstrates how much your idea will positively affect the key metric you’re trying to improve.
- `Confidence` shows how sure you are about Impact. It is also about ease of implementation in some way.
- `Ease` is about the easiness of implementation. It is an estimation of how much effort and resources are required to implement this idea.

[MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method)
- Must have
- Should have
- Could have
- Won't have (this time)

## Make it Happen 

RACI --> Tool for assigning responsibility
- R = Responsible = The doer
- A = Accountable = The buck stops here
- C = Consulted = The contributor
- I = Informed = The recipient
