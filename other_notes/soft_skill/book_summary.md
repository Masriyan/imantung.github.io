- Part three — At home: Reduce television time (or loose 20–30 hours!) and outsource household chores.
- The book has ample statistics, exciting questions, and retellings.
- 168 hours — consider a blank slate, how would you fill it?

## 5 seconds rule

<https://melrobbins.com/five-elements-5-second-rule/>

- You are one decision away from a completely different life
- You can’t control how you feel. But you can always choose how you act.
- I was the problem and in five seconds, I could push myself and become the solution.
- If you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill it

A good leader must be (The Dichotomy of Leadership):
- confident but not cocky;
- courageous but not foolhardy;
- competitive but a gracious loser;
- attentive to details but not obsessed by them;
- strong but have endurance;
- a leader and follower;
- humble not passive;
- aggressive not overbearing;
- quiet not silent;
- calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions;
- close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge.
- able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command.

A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove.
