So I got this csv file generated by [dbeaver](https://dbeaver.jkiss.org/) to trigger some automation task but my code can't process it.
The file is perfect until I open it on excel and I see this `ï»¿`. So this is the culprit. Actually it's quite famous and known as [Byte Order Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) (BOM)

Unicode text can optionally start with a byte order mark (BOM) to signal the [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) of the file or stream. Its code point is `U+FEFF`. In UTF-32 for example, a big-endian file should start with `00 00 FE FF`; a little-endian should start with `FF FE 00 00`.

In case of DBeaver, we can uncheck `Insert BOM` option when generate csv.
