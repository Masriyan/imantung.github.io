### 1. Package is a new singleton pattern
Design pattern is pattern to solve common problem programming and Singleton is pattern to solve problem if you want single instance class and it can be access globally through the code. Package in Go is pretty much feel like a Singleton.

### 2. Clean code is a language standard (gofmt)
### 3. One documentation for both inside and outside of code (godoc)
### 4. Field tagging never been this easy (struct tag)
### 5. Multiple inheritance with composition
### 6. Interfacing without implement is better.
