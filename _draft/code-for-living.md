I am a skeptical engineer by birth. From my point of view, information technology industry is both massed and messed. It’s indeed solve big problem, but doesn’t mean to not free of problems. In fact it’s bring even more (other) problem. Technology became a single point of failure by itself. 

Trend after trend. More best practices keep come to the plates like in big buffet. How come people can chewing or digest it all?  People often said “less is more”, but seeing how it come with more words, more action and more implementation, I’m not sure what is less now.  

I am really not big fans of technology trend but what can I do? I am a software engineer and this is how I make a living.  However, trend of technology is trend of world. I am grateful how it come and slap right to my face.
